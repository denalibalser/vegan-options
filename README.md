## Summary 
A web-based CRUD, MVC structured Rails application that serves the purpose of providing users with a submission-generated list of vegan friendly restaurants sorted by state. Userâ€™s are able to signup or signin (either manually or with the help of OAuth with Facebook as the provider), see their profile (which houses their information as well as any restaurants they may have submitted), go to the index page for states (each of which is a link to an index of the restaurants that have been submitted for that state), view the show page for an individual restaurant and create a review for it, create a restaurant submission, or logout. Further, users are able to edit restaurants and reviews that they submitted (only if they submitted them) as well as edit their own profile information.
